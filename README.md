[Thompson groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups) are an interesting mathematical object. 

Their generalization to n dimensions are also interesting, but not easy to deal with. This project provides a platform to play with the elements of the group - in particular, to visualize them (in dimension 1 and 2), do basic computations, and explore questions pertaining to conjugacy and growth.

See nvTrees_poster.pdf for more background.

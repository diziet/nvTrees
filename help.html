<BODY>
This applet is a calculator for the multi-dimensional Thompson groups Vn. At this moment, most of the documentation
is <a href="doc/">here</a> (in Javadoc); below are basic instructions for using the applet (to be updated).
<br>Instructions for usage: type a string to evaluate and hit Enter. Use scrollbars on the left to control zoom and scale;
the boxes on the right contain command history and list of variables. Clicking on a variable name or a command in the
history box brings it up in the command line.

<pre>
You may input a run either an application command or an expression command.


Application commands:		
  \save			Saves session to default filename ~default.nvt

  \save fname		Saves session to fname.nvt	

  \load			Loads session from default filename ~default.nvt (this happens at the start of the program if the file exists)

  \load fname		Loads session from fname.nvt : loads history and re-runs it

  \qload		Quick load from ~default.nvt: loads history and variable values; doesn't re-run history

  \qload fname		Quick load from fname.nvt: loads history and variable values; doesn't re-run history

  \clear		Clear screen	

  \reset		Resets the program	

  \pattern		Enables or disables pattern display	
		
Expression Commmands:

  expression		Evaluates the expression and displays it	

  X=expression		Evaluates the expression and assigns it to a variable X	
		
Expression may contain the following:		
  ans					The result of last calculation is stored here	

  x={treepair format string}		See treepair format below

  (any expression involving 		Ex.: $((A#!B)^(C*D))
   parentheses, variables and 
   operators)		
		
Unary operators:		

  !	inverse	
  $	reduced form	
  @	left-side-to-grid form	
		
Binary Operators:		
  *	right-action multiplication A*B	
  ^	right-action conjugation B^-1 * A * B	
  ^	power A^integer	
  #	right-action commutator B^-1 * A^-1 * B * A	
		
Tree Pair Format:
  random N C				Random tree pair with N leaves in dimension C (labels are in 1,2,...C)
  left_tree,right_tree,permutation	See Tree format below for left_tree, right_tree. 
  					See Permutation format below for permutation	
					right_tree can be replaced with “same”, then the right tree
					will be made the same as the left tree.
  
  left_tree,right_tree			A tree pair (left_tree, right_tree) with identity permutation	
		
		
Tree format:		
  random N C				Random tree with N leaves in dimension C (labels are in 1,2,...C)
  DFS of the tree as a sring		Values at nodes: colors; values at leaves: 0. 
  					Example: 10200 corresponds to the tree
							1
						       / \
						      0   2
							 / \
							0   0
 		
Permutation format:		
permutation of numbers from 1 to n		Ex.: 1 5 4 2 7 6 3 is a permutation of numbers from 1 to 7	
random						Random permutation 	
id						Identity permutation
